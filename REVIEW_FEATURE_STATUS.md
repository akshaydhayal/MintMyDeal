# Review Feature - Implementation Status

## ✅ **Review Functionality is FULLY IMPLEMENTED in Contract!**

The review feature is already built into the Solana program and ready to use. It just needs to be integrated into the frontend.

---

## 📋 **What's in the Contract**

### **1. Review Data Structure**

**File:** `contracts/programs/deal_platform/src/state.rs`

```rust
pub struct Review {
    pub user: Pubkey,        // Who wrote the review
    pub deal: Pubkey,        // Which deal they reviewed
    pub rating: u8,          // 1-5 stars
    pub comment: String,     // Review text
    pub created_at: i64,     // Timestamp
}
```

**Storage:**
- Reviews are stored as PDAs (Program Derived Addresses)
- PDA seeds: `["review", deal_pda, user_pubkey]`
- Each user can only review a deal ONCE (prevents spam)

---

### **2. Add Review Instruction**

**File:** `contracts/programs/deal_platform/src/instruction.rs`

```rust
AddReview { 
    deal_id: u64, 
    rating: u8,      // Must be 1-5
    comment: String  // Max 500 characters
}
```

**Instruction Index:** #4 (discriminant: 0x04)

---

### **3. Add Review Logic**

**File:** `contracts/programs/deal_platform/src/processor.rs`

**Function:** `process_add_review()`

**Features:**
- ✅ **Rating validation:** Must be 1-5 stars (0 or >5 rejected)
- ✅ **Comment length limit:** Max 500 characters
- ✅ **One review per user:** Cannot review same deal twice
- ✅ **User must sign:** Only the user can add their own review
- ✅ **Deal verification:** Checks deal exists and is valid
- ✅ **Timestamp:** Automatically records creation time

**Accounts Required:**
1. User (signer, payer)
2. Merchant PDA (read-only, for validation)
3. Deal PDA (read-only, to link review)
4. Review PDA (write, to create)
5. System Program (to create account)

**Error Handling:**
- `InvalidInput` if rating is 0 or >5
- `InvalidInput` if comment too long
- `Unauthorized` if not signed by user
- `AlreadyInitialized` if user already reviewed this deal
- `PdaDerivationMismatch` if PDAs don't match

---

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Review Flow:**

```
1. User wants to review Deal #5
   ↓
2. User calls AddReview instruction
   • deal_id: 5
   • rating: 4 (stars)
   • comment: "Great deal!"
   ↓
3. Contract validates:
   • Rating is 1-5? ✓
   • Comment under 500 chars? ✓
   • User hasn't reviewed this deal? ✓
   • Deal exists? ✓
   ↓
4. Contract creates Review PDA
   • Seeds: ["review", deal_pda, user_wallet]
   • Stores: user, deal, rating, comment, timestamp
   ↓
5. Review stored on-chain ✓
```

### **PDA Derivation:**

```rust
seeds: [
    b"review",           // Constant seed
    deal_pda.as_ref(),   // Deal being reviewed
    user.key.as_ref()    // User who is reviewing
]
```

**Result:** Unique review PDA for each user+deal combination

---

## 📊 **Review Constraints**

| Constraint | Value | Reason |
|------------|-------|--------|
| **Min Rating** | 1 star | No 0-star reviews |
| **Max Rating** | 5 stars | Standard rating system |
| **Max Comment** | 500 chars | Reasonable length limit |
| **Reviews per user** | 1 per deal | Prevents spam |
| **Edit reviews** | No | Once created, immutable |
| **Delete reviews** | No | Permanent on-chain |

---

## 🚫 **What's NOT Implemented (Frontend)**

Currently, the frontend does NOT have:
- ❌ Review submission form
- ❌ Review display/listing
- ❌ Star rating component
- ❌ Average rating calculation
- ❌ Review fetching logic
- ❌ Review PDA derivation helpers

---

## 🛠️ **What Needs to Be Added to Frontend**

### **1. Instruction Helper**

**File:** `frontend/src/lib/solana/instructions.ts`

Need to add:
```typescript
export function ixAddReview(
  programId: PublicKey,
  user: PublicKey,
  merchantPda: PublicKey,
  dealPda: PublicKey,
  reviewPda: PublicKey,
  dealId: bigint,
  rating: number,
  comment: string
): TransactionInstruction
```

### **2. Review PDA Helper**

```typescript
export function deriveReviewPda(
  programId: PublicKey,
  dealPda: PublicKey,
  userPubkey: PublicKey
): PublicKey
```

### **3. Fetch Reviews Helper**

```typescript
export async function fetchReviewsForDeal(
  connection: Connection,
  programId: PublicKey,
  dealPda: PublicKey
): Promise<Review[]>
```

### **4. Review UI Components**

**Components needed:**
- `<ReviewForm />` - Submit review
- `<ReviewList />` - Display reviews
- `<StarRating />` - Show/input stars
- `<ReviewCard />` - Individual review

---

## 🎨 **Suggested UI Implementation**

### **Deal Page - Review Section:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Reviews (12)          ⭐ 4.5 avg        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│ [Write a Review]                        │
│                                         │
│ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  (click to rate)              │
│ [Comment box]                           │
│ [Submit Review]                         │
│                                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ John Doe                       │
│ "Excellent deal! Saved a lot."          │
│ 2 days ago                              │
│                                         │
│ ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ Jane Smith                     │
│ "Good value, easy to redeem."           │
│ 5 days ago                              │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

   - **Consideration:** Content moderation challenges

4. **No vote system:** Can't mark reviews helpful/unhelpful
   - **Status:** Not implemented in contract
   - **Future:** Would need new instruction

---

## 🚀 **Recommended Next Steps**

### **Priority 1: Basic Implementation**
1. Add frontend helpers for review instruction
2. Create star rating component
3. Add review form to deals page
4. Display reviews for each deal
