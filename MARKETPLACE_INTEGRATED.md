# 🛒 Marketplace Integrated into Deal Platform

## ✅ What Changed

The NFT marketplace functionality has been **integrated directly into the `deal_platform` contract** for easier management and deployment.

---

## 📦 Contract Structure

### **Single Contract: `deal_platform`**

Located: `contracts/programs/deal_platform/`

**Instructions:**
```rust
pub enum DealInstruction {
    // 0-7: Original deal platform instructions
    RegisterMerchant { ... },
    CreateDeal { ... },
    MintCouponNft { ... },
    RedeemCoupon { ... },
    AddReview { ... },
    VerifyAndCountMint { ... },
    RedeemAndBurn { ... },
    SetCollectionMint { ... },
    
    // 8-9: NEW Marketplace instructions
    ListNft { price: u64 },    // List NFT for sale
    BuyNft,                     // Buy listed NFT
}
```

**State:**
```rust
// Original states
pub struct Merchant { ... }
pub struct Deal { ... }
pub struct Review { ... }
pub struct RedeemLog { ... }

// NEW Marketplace state
pub struct Listing {
    pub seller: Pubkey,
    pub nft_mint: Pubkey,
    pub price: u64,
    pub created_at: i64,
}
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### **1. List NFT**
```
User → ListNft instruction → deal_platform program
  ↓
- Creates Listing PDA (seed: "listing" + nft_mint + seller)
- Transfers NFT from seller to escrow PDA (seed: "escrow" + nft_mint)
- Stores price and listing info on-chain
```

### **2. Buy NFT**
```
Buyer → BuyNft instruction → deal_platform program
  ↓
- Transfers SOL from buyer to seller
- Transfers NFT from escrow to buyer
- Closes listing PDA (returns rent to seller)
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### **Build & Deploy:**
```bash
cd contracts
cargo build-sbf --manifest-path programs/deal_platform/Cargo.toml
solana program deploy --url devnet target/deploy/deal_platform.so
```

**That's it! Only ONE program to deploy!** 🎉

---

## 🔧 Frontend Integration

### **Configuration:**

Only ONE program ID needed in `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID=<YOUR_DEAL_PLATFORM_PROGRAM_ID>
```

No separate marketplace program ID!

### **Updated Files:**

1. **`frontend/src/lib/solana/instructions.ts`**
   - Added `IX.ListNft` (8) and `IX.BuyNft` (9) discriminants
   - Added `ListingAccount` type
   - Added marketplace helper functions:
     - `deriveListingPda()`
     - `deriveEscrowPda()`
     - `ixListNft()`
     - `ixBuyNft()`
     - `fetchListing()`
     - `fetchAllListings()`

2. **`frontend/src/app/profile/page.tsx`**
   - Updated to use `deal_platform` program ID for listing
   - Imports from `@/lib/solana/instructions`

3. **`frontend/src/app/marketplace/page.tsx`**
   - Updated to use `deal_platform` program ID for buying
   - Imports from `@/lib/solana/instructions`

4. **Deleted:**
   - `frontend/src/lib/solana/marketplace.ts` (no longer needed)

## 📊 Comparison: Before vs After

### **Before (Separate Contracts):**
```
deal_platform program      marketplace program
     ↓                            ↓
Deal operations           List/Buy operations
     ↓                            ↓
Program ID 1              Program ID 2
     ↓                            ↓
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID    NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_PROGRAM_ID
```

### **After (Integrated):**
```
deal_platform program
     ↓
All operations (deals + marketplace)
     ↓
Program ID 1
     ↓
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID
```

**Simpler! ✨**

- All imports from one helper file
- Less confusion for developers

### ✅ **Lower Costs**
- Only pay deployment costs once
- Single storage rent for the program

### ✅ **Better UX**

## 🧪 Testing

### **Run Tests:**
```bash
cd contracts/tests
bun test
```

The existing tests cover all deal platform functionality. Add marketplace-specific tests:

```typescript
// List NFT
const listIx = ixListNft(
  programId,
  seller.publicKey,
  listingPda,
  nftMint,
  sellerATA,
  escrowATA,
  TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
  BigInt(500_000_000) // 0.5 SOL
);

// Buy NFT
const buyIx = ixBuyNft(
  programId,
  buyer.publicKey,
  seller.publicKey,
  listingPda,
  nftMint,
  escrowATA,
  buyerATA,
  TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
);
```

## 📝 Migration Notes

### **If you had the separate marketplace program:**

1. **Delete old files:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf contracts/programs/marketplace
   rm frontend/src/lib/solana/marketplace.ts
   ```

2. **Update workspace Cargo.toml:**
   ```toml
   [workspace]
   members = [
       "programs/deal_platform",
       # Remove: "programs/marketplace"
   ]
   ```

3. **Remove env var:**
   ```bash
   # Remove from .env.local:
   # NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_PROGRAM_ID=...
   ```

4. **Redeploy:**
   ```bash
   cargo build-sbf --manifest-path programs/deal_platform/Cargo.toml
   solana program deploy --url devnet target/deploy/deal_platform.so
   ```

Done! 🎊
