# 🎤 Monke Deals - Presentation Script (1.5 Minutes)

---

## 📝 Script

**[Opening - 15 seconds]**

"Hey everyone! I'm excited to present **Monke Deals** - a Web3-powered deal discovery and loyalty platform built on Solana. Think Groupon, but completely decentralized and user-owned. 

**[Problem Statement - 10 seconds]**

Traditional deal platforms keep you locked in. When you buy a coupon, you can't transfer it or trade it. We're changing that with NFTs.

**[Solution & Features - 50 seconds]**

**For Merchants:**
- Register once, create unlimited deals
- Set discount percentages, expiry dates, and mint limits
- Each deal automatically mints NFT coupons when users claim them

**For Users:**
- Browse deals from verified merchants
- Mint NFT coupons with one click - you truly own them
- Transfer, trade, or sell your coupons on our built-in marketplace
- Redeem directly at merchants, which burns the NFT
- Rate and review deals to help the community

**The Marketplace:**
- Fixed-price listings - simple and secure
- Escrow system holds NFTs until sale completes
- Buyers get instant ownership, sellers get SOL

**[Tech Stack - 20 seconds]**

Built entirely on Solana:
- Native Rust program for on-chain logic
- Metaplex for NFT standards
- Next.js frontend with TypeScript
- Irys for decentralized metadata storage
- One unified contract handles everything - merchants, deals, NFTs, and marketplace

**[Closing - 15 seconds]**

Monke Deals proves that loyalty programs can be user-owned, tradeable, and decentralized. No middlemen, full transparency, complete ownership. 

Thanks for listening!"
