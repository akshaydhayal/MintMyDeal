## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Smart Contract: 2 Instructions Only**

#### **1. List NFT** (`list_nft`)
```
User → Program:
  - NFT mint address
  - Desired price (in lamports)

Program Actions:
  1. Create Listing PDA (stores price, seller, NFT info)
  2. Transfer NFT to Escrow PDA
  3. Emit listing event
```

#### **2. Buy NFT** (`buy_nft`)
```
Buyer → Program:
  - Listing PDA address

Program Actions:
  1. Transfer SOL from buyer to seller
  2. Transfer NFT from escrow to buyer
  3. Close listing PDA (return rent to seller)
```

### **PDAs Used**
- `Listing PDA`: Derived from `["listing", nft_mint, seller]`
- `Escrow PDA`: Derived from `["escrow", nft_mint]`

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### **Step 1: Build the Program**
```bash
cd contracts
cargo build-sbf --manifest-path programs/marketplace/Cargo.toml
```

### **Step 2: Deploy to Devnet**
```bash
solana program deploy \
  --url devnet \
  target/deploy/marketplace.so
```

**Copy the Program ID!** You'll need it for the frontend.

### **Step 3: Update Frontend Environment**
```bash
# Add to frontend/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_PROGRAM_ID=<YOUR_PROGRAM_ID>
```

### **Step 4: Test Locally**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🎮 User Flow

### **Seller Flow:**
```
1. Go to "Profile" page
2. See all owned NFT coupons
3. Click "💰 List for Sale"

```

### **Buyer Flow:**

## 💰 Pricing & Fees

### **Current Implementation:**
- **Platform Fee**: 0% (no fees!)
- **Seller Receives**: 100% of listing price
- **Transaction Costs**: Only Solana gas fees (~0.00001 SOL)

### **To Add Platform Fees (Optional):**
Modify `processor.rs`:
```rust
// In buy_nft function, split payment:
let platform_fee = listing.price / 50; // 2% fee
let seller_amount = listing.price - platform_fee;

// Transfer to seller
invoke(&system_instruction::transfer(
    buyer.key, 
    seller.key, 
    seller_amount
))?;

// Transfer fee to platform wallet
invoke(&system_instruction::transfer(
    buyer.key, 
    platform_wallet.key, 
    platform_fee
))?;
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### **Escrow Protection**
- NFTs held by Program PDA (not seller)
- Seller cannot cancel and retrieve after listing
- Buyer guaranteed to receive NFT on payment

### **Ownership Verification**
- Only true owner can list their NFT
- Listing tied to specific seller's wallet
- Cannot list NFTs you don't own

### **Atomic Transactions**
- Payment + NFT transfer in one transaction
- Either both succeed or both fail
- No partial state issues

## 📊 Data Structures

### **Listing (On-Chain)**
```rust
struct Listing {
    seller: Pubkey,      // Who listed it
    nft_mint: Pubkey,    // Which NFT
    price: u64,          // Price in lamports
    created_at: i64,     // Unix timestamp
}
Size: 80 bytes
```

### **Listing (Frontend)**
```typescript
interface ListingWithMetadata {
    pubkey: PublicKey;
    listing: Listing;
    nftMetadata?: {
        name: string;
        image?: string;
        uri: string;
    };
    dealInfo?: {
        pubkey: string;
        account: DealAccount;
    };
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **"Invalid Listing PDA" Error**
- Check program ID matches in frontend
- Verify NFT mint address is correct
- Ensure seller address is wallet's publicKey

### **"Insufficient Funds" Error**
- Need SOL for transaction fees (~0.001 SOL)
- Need SOL for listing price when buying
- Check wallet balance

### **NFT Not Showing in Profile**
- Wait for transaction confirmation
- Refresh page
- Check if NFT has Metaplex metadata
- Verify on Solana Explorer

### **Cannot List NFT**
- Verify you own the NFT
- Check if already listed
- Ensure wallet is connected
- Try refreshing token accounts

## 📞 Support

### **Common Questions:**

**Q: Why is my NFT not showing?**
A: Only NFTs with Metaplex Token Metadata standard are supported.

**Q: Can I cancel a listing?**
A: Not in current version. Would require adding a `cancel_listing` instruction.

**Q: What happens if buyer doesn't have SOL?**
A: Transaction fails, no state changes, NFT remains listed.

**Q: Can I list the same NFT multiple times?**
A: No, PDA derivation prevents duplicate listings.

**Q: Where does the NFT go when listed?**
A: It's transferred to an escrow PDA controlled by the program.
